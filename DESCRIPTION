Description: An R package to predict Enhancer Promoter Interactions in specific
             tissues. The package has two main use cases : the user can give a
             file with genes of interest or enhancer target pairs of interest. 
             In the first case CENTRE will generate the enhancer target pairs
             and predict how likely they are to interact in the tissue and in
             the second case it will predict how likely the given pairs are to
             interact.
